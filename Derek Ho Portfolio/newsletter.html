                <p> I began this project off by going on a couple of different sites and taking a look at their newsletter sign up. I took note of how they formatted their modal and how effective it was in getting users to sign up. The main call to action was to get the user to enter their email. The way I tackeled the problem was to make sure that the details of what the user is subscribing to is tempting enough to make them not click off the modal. I also wanted the user to see the call to action right away and for it to pop out. To do that, I made the sign up button and the input for the email address large enough to capture the user's attention. I also added colour to the sign up button to make it pop more. I also wanted the modal to be directly in the middle of the user's screen to take the attention of everything else away. Additionally, I made the exit button and the continue shopping button on the far right of the modal in order to have the user's focus on the main content of the modal. </p>

                <p>After doing some research on a couple examples, I sketched a low-fidelity wireframe of the homepage and the modal. </p>
