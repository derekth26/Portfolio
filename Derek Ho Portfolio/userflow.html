                <h3>Project Overview</h3>
                <p>This project is a donut app that I designed using Figma. The prototype features an interactive carousel that users can hold and drag to view other donuts for sale. The goal of my design is to make the user flow smooth and easy to navigate and as well as endengaging and interactive.</p>

                <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
                <p>The problem presented was to simply create a user flow for the process of finding products, viewing its details, adding it to cart and checking out.</p>

                <p>To start, I did some research on other apps to get some ideas on what I could incorporate into my design as well as take notes on any pain points. The goal was to have a simplistic design to avoid pain points and lead the user to the checkout page with no pain points. I kept my design simple and made sure elements were spaced well and large enough for users to see. The buttons were labeled as clearly as possible to assist users in understanding where it'll lead them. I also icons were properly sized and crucial elements were easy to locate.  </p>

                <h3>Development</h3>
                <p>My next steps after doing research on other apps was to create a journey map. I started from the homepage, to product page, to adding the product to cart and finally, the checkout page. Once I had completed that, made added interactions to the buttons and conducted user testing in order to discover if there are any pain points in my design. Users were easily able to navigate the app and checkout smoothly. With that done, I went ahead and sketeched a couple low-fidelity wireframes of each page. After reviewing each wireframes, I picked out the solution that I felt allowed for the best user experience. With my final design ready, I went into Figma to start creating the high-fidelity wireframes. Once completed, it was time to add the interactions to each button to bring the user to their desired destination. In retrospect, the carousel was the hardest to do because of how accurate the donut had to line up in order to get the desired smooth animation of switching from one donut to another.</p>
