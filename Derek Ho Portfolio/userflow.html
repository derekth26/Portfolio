                <h3>Project Overview</h3>
                <p>This project is a donut app that I designed using Figma. The prototype features a carousel that users can hold and drag to view other donuts for sale. The goal of my design is to make the user flow smooth, easy to navigate, engaging and interactive.</p>

                <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
                <p>The problem presented was to simply create a user flow for the process of finding products, viewing its details, adding products to the shopping cart and checking out.</p>

                <p>To start, I did some research on other apps to get some ideas on what I could incorporate into my design as well as take notes on any pain points. The goal was to have a simplistic design to avoid pain points and lead the user to the checkout page seamlessly. I kept my design simple and made sure the elements were spaced out well and large enough for users to see. The buttons were labelled clearly to assist users in understanding where it'll lead them. I also made sure the icons were properly sized and the crucial elements were easy to locate.  </p>

                <h3>Development</h3>
                <p>My next step after doing research on other apps was to create a journey map. I started with the homepage, then the product page, and finally the shopping cart page. Once I completed that, I added interactions for the buttons and carousel, then conducted user testing in order to determine if there were any pain points in my design. In retrospect, the carousel was the most difficult to create because of the accuracy in which the donuts had to line up in order to achieve the desired smooth transition of swiping from one donut to another. Users were easily able to navigate the app and get to the checkout option smoothly. Afterwards, I sketched a couple of low-fidelity wireframes of each page, reviewed each wireframe and picked out the solution that I believed offered the best user experience. With my final design ready, I went into Figma to start creating the high-fidelity wireframes. Once completed, it was time to add the interactions to each button to direct the user to their desired destination.</p>
