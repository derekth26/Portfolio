                            <h4>Case Study: User flow (Scroll Down For Prototype)</h4>
                          
                            <h5>Project Overview</h5>
                            <p>This project is a donut app that I designed using Figma. The prototype features a carousel that users can hold and drag to view other donuts for sale. The goal of my design is to make the user flow smooth, easy to navigate, engaging and interactive.</p>
                            <h5>Problem Statement</h5>
                            <p>The problem presented was to simply create a user flow for the process of finding products, viewing its details, adding products to the shopping cart and checking out.</p>
                            <h5>Design Process</h5>
                            <img src="./img/wireframes.jpg" alt="donut app prototype">
                            <img src="./img/donut.png" alt="donut app wireframes">
                            <p>To start, I did some research on other apps to get some ideas on what I could incorporate into my design as well as take notes on any pain points. The goal was to have a simplistic design to avoid pain points and lead the user to the checkout page seamlessly. I kept my design simple and made sure the elements were spaced out well and large enough for users to see. The buttons were labelled clearly to assist users in understanding where it'll lead them. I also made sure the icons were properly sized and the crucial elements were easy to locate.</p>
                            <h5>Development</h5>
                            <p>My next step after doing research on other apps was to create a journey map. I started with the homepage, then the product page, and finally the shopping cart page. Once I completed that, I added interactions for the buttons and carousel, then conducted user testing in order to determine if there were any pain points in my design. In retrospect, the carousel was the most difficult to create because of the accuracy in which the donuts had to line up in order to achieve the desired smooth transition of swiping from one donut to another. Users were easily able to navigate the app and get to the checkout option smoothly. Afterwards, I sketched a couple of low-fidelity wireframes of each page, reviewed each wireframe and picked out the solution that I believed offered the best user experience. With my final design ready, I went into Figma to start creating the high-fidelity wireframes. Once completed, it was time to add the interactions to each button to direct the user to their desired destination.</p>
                            <h5>Outcome & Results</h5>
                            <p>I've received positive feedback on my prototype and all users were able to complete tasks assigned to them without encountering any pain points.</p>

                        <h4>Case Study: Newsletter Sign Up Modal (Scroll Down For Prototype)</h4>
                        <h5>Project Overview</h5>
                        <p>This project is a newsletter sign up modal for a glasses brand that I designed using Figma.</p>
                        <h5>Problem Statement</h5>
                        <p>The problem presented was to create a newsletter sign up for a glasses brand while focusing on accessibility.</p>
                        <h5>Design Process</h5>
                        <img src="./img/newsletter.jpg" alt="newsletter prototype">
                        <img src="./img/newsletter2.png" alt="newsletter wireframe">
                        <p>I began this project by going on a couple of different sites and taking a look at their newsletter sign up modals. I took note of how they formatted their modal and how effective it was in getting users to sign up. The main call to action was to get the user to enter their email. The way I tackled the problem was to make sure that the details of what the user is subscribing to is intriguing enough to make them not click off the modal. I also wanted the user to see the call to action right away and for it to pop out. To do that, I made the sign up button and the input for the email address large enough to capture the user's attention. I also made the sign up button a bright colour to make it stand out more. As for the content, I wanted to ensure that I listed all the perks of signing up for the newsletter, but also keep it as concise as possible in order to not lose the user’s interest. Additionally, I made the exit button and the continue shopping button on the far right of the modal in order to maintain the user's focus on the central content of the modal.</p>
                        <h5>Development</h5>
                        <p>After doing some research on a couple examples, I sketched a low-fidelity wireframe of the homepage and the modal. From there, I wrote out the content that I wanted in the modal in order to get users to subscribe. After doing so, I went into Figma and created the high-fidelity wireframes, added the interactions to make the modal pop up after a certain amount of time, the thank you for signing up modal and the buttons to exit the modal.</p>

                        <h4>Case Study: Login Page (Scroll Down For Prototype)</h4>
                        <h5>Project Overview</h5>
                        <p>I designed a prototype of a login/sign up page for new or returning users trying to login to their account.</p>
                        <h5>Problem Statement</h5>
                        <p>The problem presented was to create a login page that would allow users to easily and quickly login to their account or sign up to create an account if they do not have one.</p>
                        <h5>Design Process</h5>
                        <img src="./img/login.jpg" alt="login prototype">
                        <img src="./img/login2.png" alt="login wireframe">
                        <p>To begin, I browsed other car companies and their login pages to get an idea of how I wanted my design to look like. I wanted to make sure that both login and sign up forms are clean and simple so that users would be able to complete them under 2 minutes. To do that, I would have to make the labels as clear as possible and to keep the styling of the form basic to streamline users' focus. I decided to use white and black for the colours of the form to enforce the clean and simple look. On the login page, I also wanted to allow an option for users to be able to log them in the next time they visit the site to further enhance the user experience of users who frequently visit the website. I also included the "forgot password?" option to help users that have forgotten their passwords make a new one. As for the Sign up form, I wanted to make the form as short as possible as well to further better the user experience as most users would rather not spend a considerable amount of time creating an account.</p>
                        <h5>Development</h5>
                        <p>I started off by sketching a couple low-fidelity wireframes of some ideas that I had for what I wanted the layout of the page to look like. From there, I sketched out a couple more low-fidelity wireframes of information I wanted to request for on the login and sign up form. I then went on to sketch a journey map of how a user would get from the login form to the sign up form. I would decide to have the login and sign up form all appear on one page and having a simple click result in the switching of the form. After deciding on the two drafts I wanted to use, I went into Figma to develop the high-fidelity wireframes. From there, I made variations for the form submission button and created the prototype by adding interactions where needed. </p>

                        <p>After doing some research on a couple examples, I sketched a low-fidelity wireframe of the homepage and the modal. From there, I wrote out the content that I wanted in the modal in order to get users to subscribe. After doing so, I went into Figma and created the high-fidelity wireframes, added the interactions to make the modal pop up after a certain amount of time, the thank you for signing up modal and the buttons to exit the modal.</p>
